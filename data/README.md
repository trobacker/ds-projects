# Data Directory

This directory is for storing datasets used in the projects.

**Note**: This directory is ignored by git. Do not commit large datasets to the repository.

## Data Organization

- Place raw data in `data/raw/`
- Place processed data in `data/processed/`
- Document data sources and preprocessing steps in project-specific README files

## Getting Data

For each project, document:
- Where to download the data
- Any API keys or credentials needed
- Preprocessing steps required before use
